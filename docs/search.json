    "text": "Tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassport\n\n\n\n\n\nTo re-new or get a new Indian Passport\n\nCreate an account on the Passport Seva webpage\nSchedule an appointment by paying around Rupees 1500(Non-Tatkal)/3000(Tatkal).\nDocuments needed:\n\nAADHAAR,\nPAN card\n2 Photos according to specifications.\nTatkaal/ Non Tatkaal\nTatkaal mode can get a passport wihtin a week, sometimes within 3days. Non-tatkaal takes a month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can get the necessary information at this VFS page. The Visa issued will have a validity of 4 months, during this period you are expected to get a residence permit. Here is a list of items you need for your application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa Appointment\n\n\n\n\n\nKnow your Visa category before appointment. You may book the appointment the appointment from the VFS page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not able to book an appointment online. Contact the embassy for an appointment, or ask you host to contact the embassy for an appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa category\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoc : D3/D4\nDependent Visa: DF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice Clearance Certificate (PCC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBook an appointment for from the Passport seva portal.\nCarry you passport and AADHAAR card on the scheduled date and time to the designated PAssport seva kendra. - With a couple of Photographs. (refer to the webpage to be sure of all the necessary documents)\nThe police will come to your address to verfiy and typically you should get your PCC by post in 10 days(at most).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeans of Subsistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffer letter\nBank statement (Optional)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlight Tickets\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes around 15 days for the visa application to process and to get back your passport by mail. So, book you tickets accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical and Travel Insurance\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Visa you get will have a validity of 4 months. So, you are expected to get a policy for atleast 4 months.\n\n\n\n\nOffer letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApostille\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Visa office expects certain documents like your PhD degree and marriage certificate to be apostilled.\nApostille is like an attestation process done by the Ministry of External Affairs(MEA) of India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several services which you can find online based in Delhi which get this done for a fee of approximately 1000 Rupees per document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Photos accordig to the Visa office’s specifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the appointment check if you can also get an appointment for Residence permit in Portugal. In many cases, the visa issued would have a link of the appointment for Residence permit printed on it.\n\n\n\nPlease double-check this list with the check-list which is part of Visa application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIF\n\n\n\n\n\nTax identity is very important to do almost everything else in Portugal. For example: NISS, Contract, Apartment, Residence Permit, SNS, Bank Account etc.\n\nStanding in line at early in the morning at your favourite Loja da Cidadao to get an appointment for later in the day.\nOnce you get the appointment, you host needs to be present during the appointment to vouch for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe showed up at the Loja da Cidadao at Saldanha at 4 AM and stood in line till 9 AM to get the appointment.\nI heard the Loja at Larenjeiras is better. (Worth a try!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCUL contract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour contract will be prepared by the office once you give them your NIF and a temporary address.\nYou need the signed contract for getting a Bank Account among other things.\nAfter signing the contract, you need to get a bank account to get you salary which is ususally around 23rd of each month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNISS\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Security number. Getting this easy and not as stressful as getting NIF.\nregister for your NISS at this NISS webpage you will get an e-mail within a week with a phone number. You need to call the given number and book an appointment to collect your NISS document by hand at a ISS office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appointments in Lisbon city are not immediate. If it it is urgent, you can ask them for earliest appointmet in some far away place which they will be happy to suggest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidence Permit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetiing an appointment for this is painful if you don’t already have one on your Visa.\nCheck your visa for a link which will take you to the SEF/AIMA webpage with an appointment.\nOtherwise you need to call the AIMA and book an appointment when they are open. This might take a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you search on facebook etc, you might find people who call and book and appointment on your behalf for a fee(could be around 300 euros).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidence certificate issued by Junta de Fregusia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApporoach your local Espaco Cidadao(these are different from Loja da Cidadao) with a filled in application and you would get it in a couple of days.\nThere are ways you could residence certificate Get two people who belong to the same parish to vouch for you.\nProvide your utlities bills with your address as proof. This is needed for your residence permit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSNS number\n\n\n\n\n\nServico Nacional de Saude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADSE (health insurances)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChave Movel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMB way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransport\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApartment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity and Gass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoja da Cidadao\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEspaco Cidadao\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancas"
