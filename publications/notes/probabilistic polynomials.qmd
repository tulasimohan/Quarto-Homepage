## Preliminaries

A Probabilistic polynomial is a distribution on Polynomials.

A low-degree probabilistic polynomial is a supported on low-degree polynomials.

### Possible alternatives:

-   Distribution on Polynomials of low-sparsity polynomials. What is the complexity measure to track here.

-   Right now, degree is the minimum of degrees of all polynomials in the support. Can we use an average notion?

-   PAC polynomials: Probably Approximate Polynomials.

### Applications of Probabilistic polynomials:

-   Braverman and Bazzi's poly-logarithmic independence fools \$AC\^0\$.

-   Ryan- Williams' algorithms.

Probabilistic Polynomials and Hamming Nearest Neighbours \[Alman, Williams\]

Show how to compute any symmetric Boolean function on $n$ variables over any field (as well as the integers) with a probabilistic polynomial of degree $O(\sqrt{n \log 1/\epsilon})$ and error at most Ïµ.

-   Does Probabilistic polynomials offer speed-up in for computing other functions?

    -   [ ] review and write about the proof of Bazzi and Impagliazzo's poly-logarithmic independence fools \$AC\^0\$.

-   What are tricks useful for computing functions using probabilistic polynomials?
