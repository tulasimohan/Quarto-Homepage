(Worth a try!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFCUL contract\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour contract will be prepared by the office once you give them your NIF and a temporary address.\nYou need the signed contract for getting a Bank Account among other things.\nAfter signing the contract, you need to get a bank account to get you salary which is ususally around 23rd of each month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNISS\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Security number.

You need to call the given number and book an appointment to collect your NISS document by hand at a ISS office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appointments in Lisbon city are not immediate. If it it is urgent, you can ask them for earliest appointmet in some far away place which they will be happy to suggest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidence Permit\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetiing an appointment for this is painful if you don’t already have one on your Visa.\nCheck your visa for a link which will take you to the SEF/AIMA webpage with an appointment.\nOtherwise you need to call the AIMA and book an appointment when they are open. This might take a while.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you search on facebook etc, you might find people who call and book and appointment on your behalf for a fee(could be around 300 euros).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidence certificate issued by Junta de Fregusia\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApporoach your local Espaco Cidadao(these are different from Loja da Cidadao) with a filled in application and you would get it in a couple of days.\nThere are ways you could residence certificate Get two people who belong to the same parish to vouch for you.\nProvide your utlities bills with your address as proof.
