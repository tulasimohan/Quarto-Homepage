I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Lisbon ([ULisboa]()), working under the supervision of [Bruno Loff]() on the Hardness of Finding Good Algorithms ([HoFGA]()) project. I am also a member of [LASIGE](), a research unit at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon ([FCUL]()).

I obtained my PhD from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research ([TIFR]()), Mumbai, under the guidance of [Prahladh Harsha]().

<!-- I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), during which I also attended courses at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc), Chennai. For my Master's project, I collaborated with Srikanth Srinivasan at IIT Bombay and completed a qualifier project under the guidance of Arkadev Chattopadhyay at TIFR. -->
