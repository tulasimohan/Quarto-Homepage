    "text": "Welcome to this blog post on criticality in complex systems. In this post, we will explore the concept of criticality and its significance in understanding complex systems.\n\n\nCriticality refers to the state of a system during a phase transition, where the system exhibits properties of both order and disorder. This concept is crucial in various fields such as physics, biology, and social sciences.\n\n\n\n\n\nA phase transition is a transformation between different states of matter, such as from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. In complex systems, phase transitions can occur in various forms, leading to critical behavior.\n\n\n\nSelf-organized criticality (SOC) is a property of dynamical systems that naturally evolve to a critical state without external tuning. Examples of SOC include sandpile models, forest fires, and earthquakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn physics, criticality is studied in the context of phenomena like magnetism, superconductivity, and percolation theory.\n\n\n\nIn biology, criticality helps in understanding processes such as neural activity, gene regulation, and ecosystem dynamics.\n\n\n\nIn social sciences, criticality is used to analyze social networks, market dynamics, and collective behavior.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding criticality in complex systems provides valuable insights into the behavior of various natural and artificial systems. By studying criticality, we can better predict and manage the behavior of these systems.\nThank you for reading this blog post.

    "text": "2. Preliminaries\n\nData structures in the cell-probe model\n\n[!def] Static Data Structure Problem (Static DSP) A Static Data Structure Problem is given by the tuple (D,Q,A,f) where - D is the domain of possible data, - Q is the domain of possible queries, - A is the set of possible answers and - f: Q \\times D \\to A is a map where f(x, y) is the answer to query x about data y. ^920054\n\nThe Cell Probe Model defined by Yao ~ is a deterministic model for Data Structures useful is proving lower bounds. In this model, the data is preprocessed and stored in s memory cells each capable of holding words of w bits. Each query is modelled as a decision tree which in each time step probes a memory location and based on the answer decides which location to probe next.\nA solution with parameters s, b, and t is a method of storing any y \\in D as a data structure \\phi(y) in the memory of a random access machine, using s memory cells, each containing w bits, so that any query in Q can be answered by accessing at most t memory cells.\n\n[!def] Solution/ Scheme (s,w,t) A (s,w,t) Solution to a Static Data Structure Problem (D,Q,f) is given by the tuple (s,t,\\phi,\\{Q_i\\}) where - \\phi: D \\to [2^w]^s is an encoding map - Q_i is a decision tree of depth at most t for each query i \\in Q. ^873ea3\n\nLet P = (D,Q,f) be a DSP. Under some fixed ordering the Data Domain D and Query Domain, each Static DSP can be represented using a table called the whose rows are labelled by the queries from Q and the columns are labelled by the data points/datum from D.\nSuppose the table has r = |D| rows and c = |D| columns, the is said to be r \\times c.\n\n\nWhat qualifies as a natural proof?\n\n\nCommunication Complexity\nCommunication complexity studies the number of bits of communication needed to compute a function in a game where the input is shared between the players. Typically the number of players is 2 unless specified oterwise.\nIn this model, the two players Alice and Bob are trying to compute a function f: X \\times Y \\to A. Alice gets an input x \\in X and Bob gets an input y \\in Y.\n\nProtocol\nTranscript\nProtocol tree\n\n\n[!def] Communication matrix Identify f with the matrix M with M_{x, y}= f (x, y); i.e., index the rows by Alice’s possible inputs, and the columns by Bob’s possible inputs.\n\n\nCombinatorial rectangle\nRank\nDiscrepancy\n\n\nAsymmetric Communication\nMiltersen~ considered a Communication game from a Static Data Structure Problem to prove Static Data Structure lower bounds for Polynomial Evaluation. This technique was subsequently distilled and used by Miltersen, Nisan, Safra, Wigderson~ to prove lower bounds for other data structures.\nNote that the inputs of Alice and Bob in the Miltersen’s game are not of the same length and typically Alice’s input is much smaller than Bob’s input.\nIn such a scenario, keeping track of the total communication is not very useful as it is bounded by Alice’s input length since Alice can send her input to Bob and Bob can compute the function. However, the problem still remains interesting if we restrict Alice’s communication.\nTherefore, it is natural to track the communication of Alice and Bob seperately in the Asymmetric setting.\nWe keep track of the number of bits Alice sends to Bob and the number of bits Bob sends to Alice seperately.\n\n[!def] [a,b]-protocol An [a, b]-protocol for f is a protocol where the total number of bits that Alice sends Bob is at most a and the total number of bits that Bob sends Alice is at most b. ^d55d28\n\n\n[!def] [t,a,b]^A-protocol A [t, a, b]^A-protocol for f is a protocol where each of Alice’s messages contains at most a bits and each of Bob’s messages contains at most b bits and at most t messages are sent, with Alice sending the first message. A [t, a, b]^B protocol is defined similarly. ^7fea2b",

This is a classic data structure approach. (Bentley, 1975; Lueker, 1978; Willard, 1978). Several variations exist with slightly different preprocessing/query tradeoffs.\nO(n) preprocessing, O(√n) query time: Using kd-trees. This offers a good balance, especially for lower dimensions. (Bentley, 1975)\nO(n log n/log log n) preprocessing, O(log n/log log n) query time (expected): Using range trees combined with fractional cascading. (Chazelle and Guibas, 1986). This represents a slight theoretical improvement over standard range trees.\nO(m) preprocessing, O(n/√m) query time: Using the batched range counting technique for m queries. This approach is useful when dealing with many queries at once. (Chazelle, 1988)\nO(n polylog n) preprocessing, O(logε n) query time (approximate counting): For a (1+ε)-approximation. Allows for significantly faster queries at the cost of some error. (Arya and Mount, 2000)\n\nLower Bounds:\n\nΩ(log n/log log n) query time: Under the pointer machine model. (Chazelle, 1990) This indicates that, up to polylogarithmic factors, the range tree with fractional cascading is close to optimal in this model.\nΩ(√n) query time (for linear space): Under the algebraic decision tree model. (Fredman, 1982) This implies that kd-trees are near-optimal for linear",
