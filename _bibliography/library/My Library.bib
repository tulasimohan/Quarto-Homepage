  abstract = {We investigate one of the fundamental areas in computational geometry: lower bounds for range reporting problems in the pointer machine and the external memory models. We develop new techniques that lead to new and improved lower bounds for simplex range reporting as well as some other geometric problems. Simplex range reporting is the problem of storing n points in the d-dimensional space in a data structure such that the k points that lie inside a query simplex can be found efficiently. This is one of the fundamental and extensively studied problems in computational geometry. Currently, the best data structures for the problem achieve Q(n) + O(k) query time using  space in which the  notation either hides a polylogarithmic or an n{$\varepsilon$} factor for any constant {$\varepsilon$} {$>$} 0, (depending on the data structure and Q(n)). The best lower bound on this problem is due to Chazelle and Rosenberg who showed any pointer machine data structure that can answer queries in O(n{$\gamma$} + k) time must use {\textohm}(nd-{$\varepsilon$}-d{$\gamma$}) space. Observe that this bound is a polynomial factor away from the best known data structures. In this article, we improve the space lower bound to . Not only this bridges the gap from polynomial to sub-polynomial, it also offers a smooth trade-off curve. For instance, for polylogarithmic values of Q(n), our space lower bound almost equals {\textohm}((n/Q(n))d); the latter is generally believed to be the ``right'' bound. By a simple geometric transformation, we also improve the best lower bounds for the halfspace range reporting problem. Furthermore, we study the external memory model and offer a new simple framework for proving lower bounds in this model. We show that answering simplex range reporting queries with Q(n)+O(k/B) I/Os requires ) space or  blocks, in which B is the block size.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a significant increase in our understanding of high-dimensional nearest neighbor search (NNS) for distances like the lscr1 and lscr2 norms. By contrast, our understanding of the lscrinfin norm is now where it was (exactly) 10 years ago. In FOCSpsila98, Indyk proved the following unorthodox result: there is a data structure (in fact, a decision tree) of size O(nrho), for any rho {$>$} 1, which achieves approximation O(logrho log d) for NNS in the d-dimensional lscr1 metric. In this paper, we provide results that indicate that Indykpsilas unconventional bound might in fact be optimal. Specifically, we show a lower bound for the asymmetric communication complexity of NNS under lscrinfin, which proves that this space/approximation trade-off is optimal for decision trees and for data structures with constant cell-probe complexity.},

Our bounds are in the form of a tradeoff among the number of cells, the size of a cell, and the search time. For example, suppose we are searching among n points in the d dimensional cube, we use poly(n, d) cells, each containing poly(d, log n) bits. We get a lower bound of W(d/log n) on the search time, a significant improvement over the recent bound of W(log d) of Borodin et al. This should be contrasted with the upper bound of O(log log d) for approximate search (and O(1) for a decision version of the problem; our lower bounds hold in that case). By previous results, the bounds for the cube imply similar bounds for nearest neighbor search in high dimensional Euclidean space, and for other geometric problems.},

For                              , the                              -error probabilistic degree of any Boolean function               f               \,:\,\{0,\,1\}                                n                              \,{$\rightarrow$}\,\{0,\,1\} over                              is the smallest nonnegative integer               d               such that the following holds: there exists a distribution               P               of polynomials                              of degree at most               d               such that for all                              , we have                              . It is known from the works of Tarui (               Theoret. Comput. Sci.               1993) and Beigel, Reingold, and Spielman (               Proc.~6th CCC               1991), that the                              -error probabilistic degree of the OR function is at most                              . Our first observation is that this can be improved to                              which is better for small values of                              . In all known constructions of probabilistic polynomials for the OR function (including the above improvement), the polynomials               P               in the support of the distribution               P               have the following special structure:                              where each               L                                i                              (               x               1               ,\,{\dots}\,,\,               x                                n                              ) is a linear form in the variables               x               1               ,\,{\dots}\,,\,               x                                n                              , that is, the polynomial                              is a product of affine forms. We show that the                              -error probabilistic degree of OR when restricted to polynomials of the above form is                              , thus matching the above upper bound (up to poly-logarithmic factors).},

  abstract = {The curse of dimensionality describes the phenomenon  whereby (in spite of extensive and continuing research)  for various geometric search problems we only have algorithms with performance that grows exponentially in  the dimension. Recent results [31, 30, 331 show that in  some sense it is possible to avoid the curse of dimensionality for the approximate nearest neighbor search  problem. But must the exact nearest neighbor search  problem suffer this curse? We provide some evidence  in support of the curse. Specifically we investigate the  exact nearest neighbor search problem and the related  problem of exact partial match within the asymmetric communication model first used by Miltersen [36] to  study data structure problems. We derive non-trivial  asymptotic lower bounds for the exact problem that  stand in contrast to known algorithms for approximate  nearest neighbor search.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the role non-adaptivity plays in maintaining dynamic data structures. Roughly speaking, a data structure is non-adaptive if the memory locations it reads and/or writes when processing a query or update depend only on the query or update and not on the contents of previously read cells. We study such non-adaptive data structures in the cell probe model. The cell probe model is one of the least restrictive lower bound models and in particular, cell probe lower bounds apply to data structures developed in the popular word-RAM model. Unfortunately, this generality comes at a high cost: the highest lower bound proved for any data structure problem is only polylogarithmic (if allowed adaptivity). Our main result is to demonstrate that one can in fact obtain polynomial cell probe lower bounds for non-adaptive data structures. To shed more light on the seemingly inherent polylogarithmic lower bound barrier, we study several different notions of non-adaptivity and identify key properties that must be dealt with if we are to prove polynomial lower bounds without restrictions on the data structures. Finally, our results also unveil an interesting connection between data structures and depth-2 circuits. This allows us to translate conjectured hard data structure problems into good candidates for high circuit lower bounds; in particular, in the area of linear circuits for linear operators. Building on lower bound proofs for data structures in slightly more restrictive models, we also present a number of properties of linear operators which we believe are worth investigating in the realm of circuit lower bounds.},

We use the same property of the gadget, stifling, which was introduced by Chattopadhyay, Mande, Sanyal and Sherif [ITCS'23] to prove a lifting theorem for deterministic PDTs. Moreover, even the milder condition that the gadget has minimum parity certificate complexity at least 2 suffices for lifting to randomized PDT size.        To further improve the dependence on the gadget g in the lower bounds for composed functions, we consider a related problem g whose inputs are certificates of g. It is implicit in the work of Chattopadhyay et al. that for any function f, lower bounds for the -depth of f  give lower bounds for the PDT size of f. We make this connection explicit in the deterministic case and show that it also holds for  randomized PDTs. We then combine this with composition theorems for -depth, which follow by adapting known composition theorems for decision trees. As a corollary, we get tight lifting theorems when the gadget is Indexing, Inner Product or Disjointness.},

  abstract = {Proving superpolylogarithmic lower bounds for dynamic data structures has remained an open problem despite years of research. P{\v a}tra{\c s}cu proposed an exciting approach for breaking this barrier via a two-player communication model in which one player gets private advice at the beginning of the protocol. He gave reductions from the problem of solving an asymmetric version of set-disjointness in his model to a diverse collection of natural dynamic data structure problems in the cell probe model. He also conjectured that, for any hard problem in the standard two-party communication model, the asymmetric version of the problem is hard in his model, provided not too much advice is given. In this paper, we prove several surprising results about his model. We show that there exist Boolean functions requiring linear randomized communication complexity in the two-party model, for which the asymmetric versions  in his model have deterministic protocols with exponentially smaller complexity. For set-disjointness, which also requires linear randomized communication complexity in the two-party model, we give a deterministic protocol for the asymmetric version in his model with a quadratic improvement in complexity. These results demonstrate that P{\v a}tra{\c s}cu's conjecture, as stated, is false. In addition, we show that the randomized and deterministic communication complexities of problems in his model differ by no more than a logarithmic multiplicative factor. We also prove lower bounds in some restricted versions of this model for natural functions such as set-disjointness and inner product. All of our upper bounds conform to these restrictions. Moreover, a special case of one of these lower bounds implies a new proof of a strong lower bound on the tradeoff between the query time and the amortized update time of dynamic data structures with nonadaptive query algorithms.},

  abstract = {Chang's lemma (Duke Mathematical Journal, 2002) is a classical result in mathematics, with applications spanning across additive combinatorics, combinatorial number theory, analysis of Boolean functions, communication complexity and algorithm design. For a Boolean function f that takes values in \{-1, 1\} let r(f) denote its Fourier rank (i.e., the dimension of the span of its Fourier support). For each positive threshold t, Chang's lemma provides a lower bound on {$\delta$}(f) := Pr[f(x) = -1] in terms of the dimension of the span of its characters with Fourier coefficients of magnitude at least 1/t. In this work we examine the tightness of Chang's lemma with respect to the following three natural settings of the threshold:    - the Fourier sparsity of f, denoted k(f),   - the Fourier max-supp-entropy of f, denoted k'(f), defined to be the maximum value of the reciprocal of the absolute value of a non-zero Fourier coefficient,   - the Fourier max-rank-entropy of f, denoted k''(f), defined to be the minimum t such that characters whose coefficients are at least 1/t in magnitude span a r(f)-dimensional space.  In this work we prove new lower bounds on {$\delta$}(f) in terms of the above measures. One of our lower bounds, {$\delta$}(f) = {\textohm}(r(f){$^2$}/(k(f) log{$^2$} k(f))), subsumes and refines the previously best known upper bound r(f) = O({\textsurd}\{k(f)\}log k(f)) on r(f) in terms of k(f) by Sanyal (Theory of Computing, 2019). We improve upon this bound and show r(f) = O({\textsurd}\{k(f){$\delta$}(f)\}log k(f)). Another lower bound, {$\delta$}(f) = {\textohm}(r(f)/(k''(f) log k(f))), is based on our improvement of a bound by Chattopadhyay, Hatami, Lovett and Tal (ITCS, 2019) on the sum of absolute values of level-1 Fourier coefficients in terms of {$\mathbb{F}_2$}-degree. We further show that Chang's lemma for the above-mentioned choices of the threshold is asymptotically outperformed by our bounds for most settings of the parameters involved.  Next, we show that our bounds are tight for a wide range of the parameters involved, by constructing functions witnessing their tightness. All the functions we construct are modifications of the Addressing function, where we replace certain input variables by suitable functions. Our final contribution is to construct Boolean functions f for which our lower bounds asymptotically match {$\delta$}(f), and for any choice of the threshold t, the lower bound obtained from Chang's lemma is asymptotically smaller than {$\delta$}(f).  Our results imply more refined deterministic one-way communication complexity upper bounds for XOR functions. Given the wide-ranging application of Chang's lemma to areas like additive combinatorics, learning theory and communication complexity, we strongly feel that our refinements of Chang's lemma will find many more applications.},

In particular, any polynomial-sized linear program for M               ax               C               ut               has an integrality gap of {$\frac{1}{2}$} and any such linear program for M               ax               3-S               at               has an integrality gap of {$\frac{7}{8}$}.},

  abstract = {A mode of a multiset S is an element a{$\in$}S of maximum multiplicity; that is, a occurs at least as frequently as any other element in S. Given an array A[1:n] of n elements, we consider a basic problem: constructing a static data structure that efficiently answers range mode queries on A. Each query consists of an input pair of indices (i,j) for which a mode of A[i:j] must be returned. The best previous data structure with linear space, by Krizanc, Morin, and Smid (Proceedings of the International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC), pp.~517--526, 2003), requires \${\textbackslash}varTheta ({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log n)\$query time in the worst case. We improve their result and present an O(n)-space data structure that supports range mode queries in \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n/{\textbackslash}log n\})\$worst-case time. In the external memory model, we give a linear-space data structure that requires \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n/B\})\$I/Os per query, where B denotes the block size. Furthermore, we present strong evidence that a query time significantly below \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\$cannot be achieved by purely combinatorial techniques; we show that boolean matrix multiplication of two \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\} {\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}\$matrices reduces to n range mode queries in an array of size O(n).},

  abstract = {Proving superpolylogarithmic lower bounds for dynamic data structures has remained an open problem despite years of research. Recently P{\u a}tra{\c s}cu proposed an exciting new approach for breaking this barrier via a two player communication model in which one player gets private advice at the beginning of the protocol. He gave reductions from the problem of solving an asymmetric version of set-disjointness in his model to a diverse collection of natural dynamic data structure problems in the cell probe model. He also conjectured that, for any hard problem in the standard two-party communication model, the asymmetric version of the problem is hard in his model, provided not too much advice is given.In this paper, we prove several surprising results about his model. We show that there exist Boolean functions requiring linear randomized communication complexity in the two-party model, for which the asymmetric versions in his model have deterministic protocols with exponentially smaller complexity. For set-disjointness, which also requires linear randomized communication complexity in the two-party model, we give a deterministic protocol for the asymmetric version in his model with a quadratic improvement in complexity. These results demonstrate that P{\u a}tra{\c s}cu's conjecture, as stated, is false. In addition, we show that the randomized and deterministic communication complexities of problems in his model differ by no more than a logarithmic multiplicative factor.We also prove lower bounds in some restricted versions of this model for natural functions such as set-disjointness and inner product. All of our upper bounds conform to these restrictions.},

  abstract = {We construct a simple and total XOR function F on 2n variables that has only O({\textsurd}n) spectral norm, O(n2) approximate rank and O(n2.5) approximate nonnegative rank. We show it has polynomially large randomized bounded-error communication complexity of {\textohm}({\textsurd}n). This yields the first exponential gap between the logarithm of the approximate rank and randomized communication complexity for total functions. Thus F witnesses a refutation of the Log-Approximate-Rank Conjecture (LARC) which was posed by Lee and Shraibman as a very natural analogue for randomized communication of the still unresolved Log-Rank Conjecture for deterministic communication. The best known previous gap for any total function between the two measures is a recent 4th-power separation by G'o'os, Jayram, Pitassi and Watson. Additionally, our function F refutes Grolmusz's Conjecture and a variant of the Log-Approximate-Nonnegative-Rank Conjecture, suggested recently by Kol, Moran, Shpilka and Yehudayoff, both of which are implied by the LARC. The complement of F has exponentially large approximate nonnegative rank. This answers a question of Lee and Kol et al., showing that approximate nonnegative rank can be exponentially larger than approximate rank. The function F also falsifies a conjecture about parity measures of Boolean functions made by Tsang, Wong, Xie and Zhang. The latter conjecture implied the Log-Rank Conjecture for XOR functions. We are pleased to note that shortly after we published our results two independent groups of researchers, Anshu, Boddu and Touchette, and Sinha and de Wolf, used our function F to prove that the Quantum-Log-Rank Conjecture is also false by showing that F has {\textohm}(n1/6) quantum communication complexity.},

  abstract = {We develop a new technique for proving lower bounds in the setting of asymmetric communication, a model that was introduced in the famous works of Miltersen (STOC'94) and Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson (STOC'95). At the core of our technique is the first simulation theorem in the asymmetric setting, where Alice gets a p {\texttimes} n matrix x over F2 and Bob gets a vector y {$\in$} F2n. Alice and Bob need to evaluate f(x{$\cdot$} y) for a Boolean function f: \{0,1\}p {$\rightarrow$} \{0,1\}. Our simulation theorems show that a deterministic/randomized communication protocol exists for this problem, with cost C{$\cdot$} n for Alice and C for Bob, if and only if there exists a deterministic/randomized *parity decision tree* of cost {$\Theta$}(C) for evaluating f. As applications of this technique, we obtain the following results: 1. The first strong lower-bounds against randomized data-structure schemes for the Vector-Matrix-Vector product problem over F2. Moreover, our method yields strong lower bounds even when the data-structure scheme has tiny advantage over random guessing. 2. The first lower bounds against randomized data-structures schemes for two natural Boolean variants of Orthogonal Vector Counting. 3. We construct an asymmetric communication problem and obtain a deterministic lower-bound for it which is provably better than any lower-bound that may be obtained by the classical Richness Method of Miltersen et al. (STOC '95). This seems to be the first known limitation of the Richness Method in the context of proving deterministic lower bounds.},

  abstract = {There has been a resurgence of interest in lower bounds whose truth rests on the conjectured hardness of well known computational problems. These conditional lower bounds have become important and popular due to the painfully slow progress on proving strong unconditional lower bounds. Nevertheless, the long term goal is to replace these conditional bounds with unconditional ones. In this paper we make progress in this direction by studying the cell probe complexity of two conjectured to be hard problems of particular importance: matrix-vector multiplication and a version of dynamic set disjointness known as Patrascu's Multiphase Problem. We give improved unconditional lower bounds for these problems as well as introducing new proof techniques of independent interest. These include a technique capable of proving strong threshold lower bounds of the following form: If we insist on having a very fast query time, then the update time has to be slow enough to compute a lookup table with the answer to every possible query. This is the first time a lower bound of this type has been proven.},

  abstract = {Dynamic data structure problems involve the representation of data in memory in such a way as to permit certain types of modifications of the data (updates) and certain types of questions about the data (queries). This paradigm encompasses many fundamental problems in computer science.The purpose of this paper is to prove new lower and upper bounds on the time per operation to implement solutions to some familiar dynamic data structure problems including list representation, subset ranking, partial sums, and the set union problem. The main features of our lower bounds are: They hold in the cell probe model of computation (A. Yao [18]) in which the time complexity of a sequential computation is defined to be the number of words of memory that are accessed. (The number of bits b in a single word of memory is a parameter of the model). All other computations are free. This model is at least as powerful as a random access machine and allows for unusual representation of data, indirect addressing etc. This contrasts with most previous lower bounds which are proved in models (e.g., algebraic, comparison, pointer manipulation) which require restrictions on the way data is represented and manipulated.The lower bound method presented here can be used to derive amortized complexities, worst case per operation complexities, and randomized complexities.The results occasionally provide (nearly tight) tradeoffs between the number R of words of memory that are read per operation, the number W of memory words rewritten per operation and the size b of each word. For the problems considered here there is a parameter n that represents the size of the data set being manipulated and for these problems b = logn is a natural register size to consider. By letting b vary, our results illustrate the effect of register size on time complexity. For instance, one consequence of the results is that for some of the problems considered here, increasing the register size from logn to polylog(n) only reduces the time complexity by a constant factor. On the other hand, decreasing the register size from logn to 1 increases time complexity by a logn factor for one of the problems we consider and only a loglogn factor for some other problems.The first two specific data structure problems for which we obtain bounds are: List Representation. This problem concerns the representation of an ordered list of at most n (not necessarily distinct) elements from the universe U = \{1, 2,{\dots}, n\}. The operations to be supported are report(k), which returns the kth element of the list, insert(k, u) which inserts element u into the list between the elements in positions k - 1 and k, delete(k), which deletes the kth item.Subset Rank. This problem concerns the representation of a subset S of U = \{1, 2,{\dots}, n\}. The operations that must be supported are the updates ``insert item j into the set'' and ``delete item j from the set'' and the queries rank(j), which returns the number of elements in S that are less than or equal to j.The natural word size for these problems is b = logn, which allows an item of U or an index into the list to be stored in one register. One simple solution to the list representation problem is to maintain a vector v, whose kth entry contains the kth item of the list. The report operation can be done in constant time, but the insert and delete operations may take time linear in the length of the list. Alternatively, one could store the items of the list with each element having a pointer to its predecessor and successor in the list. This allows for constant time updates (given a pointer to the appropriate location), but requires linear cost for queries.This problem can be solved must more efficiently by use of balanced trees (such as AVL trees). When b = logn, the worst case cost per operation using AVL trees is O(logn). If instead b = 1, so that each bit access costs 1, then the AVL three solution requires O(log2n) per operation.It is not hard to find similar upper bounds for the subset rank problem (the algorithms for this problem are actually simpler than AVL trees).The question is: are these upper bounds bet possible? Our results show that the upper bounds for the case of logn bit registers are within a loglogn factor of optimal. On the other hand, somewhat surprisingly, for the case of single bit registers there are implementations for both of these problems that run in time significantly faster than O(log2n) per operation.Let CPROBE(b) denote the cell probe computational model with register size b.Theorem 1. If b {$\leq$} (logn)t for some t, then any CPROBE(b) implementation of either list representation or the subset rank requires {\textohm}(logn/loglogn) amortized time per operation.Theorem 2. Subset rank and list representation have CPROBE(1) implementations with respective complexities O((logn)(loglogn)) and O((logn)(loglogn)2) per operation.Paul Dietz (personal communication) has found an implementation of list representation with logn bit registers that requires only O(logn/loglogn) time per operation, and thus the result of theorem 1 is best possible.The lower bounds of theorem 1 are derived from lower bounds for a third problem: Partial sum mode k. An array A[1],{\dots}, A[N] of integers mod k is to be represented. Updates are add(i, {$\delta$}) which implements A[i] {\textleftarrow} A[i] + {$\delta$}; and queries are sum(j) which returns {$\Sigma$}i{$\leq$}jA[i] (mod k).This problem is demoted PS(n, k). Our main lower bound theorems provide tradeoffs between the number of register rewrites and register reads as a function of n, k, and b. Two corollaries of these results are: Theorem 3. Any CPROBE(b) implementation of PS(n, 2) (partial sums mod 2) requires {\textohm}(logn/(loglogn + logb)) amortized time per operation, and for b {$\geq$} logn, there is an implementation that achieves this. In particular, if b = {$\Theta$}((logn)c) for some constant c, then the optimal time complexity of PS(n, 2) is {\texttheta}(logn/loglogn).Theorem 4. Any CPROBE(1) implementation of PS(n, n) with single bit registers requires {\textohm}((logn/loglogn)2) amortized time per operation, and there is an implementation that achieves O(log2n) time per operation.It can be shown that a lower bound of PS(n, 2) is also a lower bound for both list representation and subset rank (the details, which are not difficult, are omitted from this report), and thus theorem 1 follows from theorem 3. The results of theorem 4 make an interesting contrast with those of theorem 2. For the three problems, list representation, subset rank and PS(n, k), there are standard algorithms that can be implemented on a CPROBE(logn) that use time O(logn per operation, and their implementations on CPROBE(1) require O(log2n) time. Theorem 4 says that for the problem PS(n, n) this algorithm is essentially best possible, while theorem 2 says that for list representation and rank, the algorithm can be significantly improved. In fact, the rank problem an be viewed as a special case of PS(n, n) where the variables take on values on \{0, 1\}, and apparently this specialization is enough to reduce the complexity on a CPROBE(1) by a factor of logn/loglogn, even though on a CPROBE(logn) the complexities of the two problems differ by no more than a loglogn factor.The third problem we consider is the set union problem. This problem concerns the design of a data structure for the on-line manipulation of sets in the following setting. Initially, there are n singleton sets \{1\}, \{2\},{\dots}, \{n\} with i chosen as the name of the set \{i\}. Our data structure is required to implement two operations, Find(j), and Union(A, B, C). The operation Find(j) returns the name of the set containing j. The operation Union(A, B, C) combines the sets with names A and B. The names of the existing sets at any moment must be unique and chosen to be integers in the range from 1 to 2n. The sets existing at any time are disjoint and define a partition of the elements into equivalence classes.A well known data structure for the set union problem represents the sets as trees and stores the name of a set in the root of its corresponding tree. A Union operation is performed by attaching the root of the smaller set as a child of the root of the larger set (weight rule). A Find operation is implemented by following the path from the appropriate node to the root of the tree containing it, and then redirecting to the root the parent pointers of the nodes encountered along this path (path compression). From now on we consider sequences of Union and Find operations consisting of n-1 Union operations and m Find operations with m {$\geq$} n. Tarjan [14] demonstrated that the above algorithm requires time {\texttheta}(m{$\alpha$}(m, n)), where {$\alpha$}(m, n) is an inverse to Ackermann's function, to execute n-1 Union and m Find operations. In particular, if m = {\texttheta}(n), then the running time is almost, but not quite, linear. Tarjan conjectured [14] that no linear time algorithm exists for the set union problem, and provided significant evidence in favor of this conjecture (which we discuss in the following section). We affirm Tarjan's conjecture in the CPROBE(logn) model.Theorem 5. Any CPROBE(logn) implementation of the set union problem requires {\textohm}(m{$\alpha$}(m, n)) time to execute m Find's and n-1 Union's, beginning with n singleton sets.N. Blum [2] has given a logn/loglogn algorithm (worst case time per operation) for the set union problem. This algorithm is also optimal in the CPROBE(polylogn) model.The following Section provides further discussion of these results, Section 3 outlines our lower bound method, and Section 4 contains some proofs.},

  abstract = {We consider time-space tradeoffs for static data structure problems in the cell probe model with word size 1 (the bit probe model). In this model, the goal is to represent n-bit data with s=n+r bits such that queries (of a certain type) about the data can be answered by reading at most t bits of the representation. Ideally, we would like to keep both s and t small, but there are tradeoffs between the values of s and t that limit the possibilities of keeping both parameters small. In this paper, we consider the case of succinct representations, where s=n+r for some redundancy r{$\ll$}n. For a Boolean version of the problem of polynomial evaluation with preprocessing of coefficients, we show a lower bound on the redundancy--query time tradeoff of the form (r+1)t{$\geq\Omega$}(n/logn). In particular, for very small redundancies r, we get an almost optimal lower bound stating that the query algorithm has to inspect almost the entire data structure (up to a logarithmic factor). We show similar lower bounds for problems satisfying a certain combinatorial properties of a coding theoretic flavor, and obtain (r+1)t{$\geq\Omega$}(n) for certain problems. Previously, no {$\omega$}(m) lower bounds were known on t in the general model for explicit Boolean problems, even for very small redundancies. By restricting our attention to systematic or index structures {$\phi$} satisfying {$\phi$}(x)=x{$\cdot\phi\ast$}(x) for some map {$\phi\ast$} (where {$\cdot$} denotes concatenation), we show similar lower bounds on the redundancy--query time tradeoff for the natural data structuring problems of Prefix Sum and Substring Search.},

  abstract = {This book is rooted in the thesis that complexity theory is extremely rich in conceptual content, and that this contents should be explicitly communicated in expositions and courses on the subject. The desire to provide a corresponding textbook is indeed the motivation for writing the current book and its main governing principle.The book offers a conceptual perspective on complexity theory, and the presentation is designed to highlight this perspective. It is intended mainly for students that wish to learn complexity theory and for educators that intend to teach a course on complexity theory. The book is also intended to promote interest in complexity theory and make it acccessible to general readers with adequate background (which is mainly being comfortable with abstract discussions, definitions and proofs). We expect most readers to have a basic knowledge of algorithms, or at least be fairly comfortable with the notion of an algorithm.The book focuses on several sub-areas of complexity theory (including, e.g., pseudorandomness and probabilistic proof systems). In each case, the exposition starts from the intuitive questions addresses by the sub-area, as embodied in the concepts that it studies. The exposition discusses the fundamental importance of these questions, the choices made in the actual formulation of these questions and notions, the approaches that underly the answers, and the ideas that are embedded in these answers. Our view is that these ({\textbackslash}non-technical") aspects are the core of the field, and the presentation attempts to re ect this view.},

This problem can be motivated by the goal of outsourcing computations on sensitive data to two servers in the cloud, where both servers can be simultaneously corrupted by viruses that have a limited communication bandwidth. We present a simple and efficient reduction of the above problem to that of constructing parity-resilient circuits, namely circuits that map an encoded input to an encoded output so that the parity of any subset of the wires is essentially independent of the input. We then construct parity-resilient circuits from circuits that are resilient to local leakage, which can in turn be obtained from protocols for secure multiparty computation. Our main reduction builds on a novel generalization of the {$\varepsilon$}-biased masking lemma that applies to interactive protocols. Applying the above, we obtain two-party protocols with resilience to bounded-communication leakage either in the information-theoretic setting, relying on random oblivious transfer correlations, or in the computational setting, relying on non-committing encryption which can be based on a variety of standard cryptographic assumptions.},

These lower bounds are tight for numerous static data structure problems. Moreover, he also showed that reachability in the butterfly graph reduces to dynamic marked ancestor, a classic problem used to prove lower bounds for dynamic data structures. Unfortunately, P{\v a}tra{\c s}cu's reduction to marked ancestor loses a lg lg n factor and therefore falls short of fully recovering all the previous dynamic data structure lower bounds that follow from marked ancestor. In this paper, we revisit P{\v a}tra{\c s}cu's work and give a new lossless reduction to dynamic marked ancestor, thereby establishing reachability in the butterfly graph as a single seed problem from which a range of tight static and dynamic data structure lower bounds follow.},

  abstract = {In the orthogonal range reporting problem, we are to preprocess a set of n points with integer coordinates on a UxU grid. The goal is to support reporting all k points inside an axis-aligned query rectangle. This is one of the most fundamental data structure problems in databases and computational geometry. Despite the importance of the problem its complexity remains unresolved in the word-RAM. On the upper bound side, three best tradeoffs exist, all derived by reducing range reporting to a ball-inheritance problem. Ball-inheritance is a problem that essentially encapsulates all previous attempts at solving range reporting in the word-RAM. In this paper we make progress towards closing the gap between the upper and lower bounds for range reporting by proving cell probe lower bounds for ball-inheritance. Our lower bounds are tight for a large range of parameters, excluding any further progress for range reporting using the ball-inheritance reduction.},

  abstract = {Rossman [In Proc. 34th Comput. Complexity Conf., 2019] introduced the notion of criticality. The criticality of a Boolean function f : \{0,1\}{$^n$} {$\rightarrow$} \{0,1\} is the minimum {$\lambda$} {$\geq$} 1 such that for all positive integers t and all p {$\in$} [0,1], Pr\_\{{$\rho\simR\_$}p\}[DT\_\{depth\}(f{\textbar}\_{$\rho$}) {$\geq$} t] {$\leq$} (p{$\lambda$}){\textasciicircum}t, where {$R\_$}p refers to the distribution of p-random restrictions.  H{\aa}stad's celebrated switching lemma shows that the criticality of any k-DNF is at most O(k). Subsequent improvements to correlation bounds of AC{$^0$}-circuits against parity showed that the criticality of any AC{$^0$}-circuit of size S and depth d+1 is at most O(log S){\textasciicircum}d and any regular AC{$^0$}-formula of size S and depth d+1 is at most O((1/d){$\cdot$}log S){\textasciicircum}d. We strengthen these results by showing that the criticality of any AC{$^0$}-formula (not necessarily regular) of size S and depth d+1 is at most O((log S)/d){\textasciicircum}d, resolving a conjecture due to Rossman.   This result also implies Rossman's optimal lower bound on the size of any depth-d AC{$^0$}-formula computing parity [Comput. Complexity, 27(2):209-223, 2018.]. Our result implies tight correlation bounds against parity, tight Fourier concentration results and improved \#SAT algorithm for AC{$^0$}-formulae.},

We improve this upper bound to                              , which is much better for small values of                              . We then use this result to show that                              -wise independence fools                              circuits of size                              and depth                              up to error at most                              , improving on Tal's strengthening of Braverman's result that                              -wise independence suffices. To our knowledge, this is the first PRG construction for                              that achieves optimal dependence on the error                              . We also prove lower bounds on the best polynomial approximations to                              .

  abstract = {In recent years, a very exciting and promising method for proving lower bounds for arithmetic circuits has been proposed. This method combines the method of depth reduction developed in the works of Agrawal and Vinay [FOCS, IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, 2008, pp. 67--75], Koiran [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 448 (2012), pp. 56--65], and Tavenas [Inform. and Comput., 240 (2015), pp, 2--11],  and the use of the shifted partial derivative complexity measure developed in the works of Kayal [Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity, TR12-081, 2012] and Gupta et al. [J. ACM, 61 (2014), 33]. These results inspired a flurry of other beautiful results and strong lower bounds for various classes of arithmetic circuits, in particular a recent work of Kayal, Saha, and Saptharishi [STOC, ACM, New York, 2014, pp. 146--153] showing superpolynomial lower bounds for regular arithmetic formulas via an improved depth reduction for these formulas. It was left as an intriguing question if these methods could prove superpolynomial lower bounds for general (homogeneous) arithmetic formulas, and if so this would indeed be a breakthrough in arithmetic circuit complexity. In this paper we study the power and limitations of depth reduction and shifted partial derivatives  for arithmetic formulas. We do it via studying the class of depth 4 homogeneous arithmetic circuits. We show: (1) the first superpolynomial lower bounds for the class of homogeneous depth 4 circuits with top fan-in o(log⁡n). The core of our result is to show  improved depth reduction for these circuits. This class of circuits has received much attention for the problem of polynomial identity testing. We give the first nontrivial lower bounds for these circuits for any top fan-in {$\geq$}2.  (2) We show that improved depth reduction is not possible when the top fan-in is {\textohm}(log⁡n). In particular this shows that the depth reduction procedure of Koiran [Theoret. Comput. Sci., 448 (2012), pp. 56--65] and Tavenas [Inform. and Comput., 240 (2012), pp, 2--11] cannot be improved even for homogeneous formulas, thus strengthening the results of Fournier et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 44 (2015), pp, 1173--1201] who showed that depth reduction is tight for circuits, and answering some of the main open questions of [N. Kayal, C. Saha, and R. Saptharishi, STOC, ACM, New York, 2014, pp. 146--153] and [H. Fournier et al. SIAM J. Comput., 44 (2015), pp, 1173--1201].   Our results in particular suggest that the method of improved depth reduction and shifted partial derivatives may not be powerful enough to prove superpolynomial lower bounds for (even homogeneous) arithmetic formulas.},

  abstract = {Consider the following Online Boolean Matrix-Vector Multiplication problem: We are given an n x n matrix M and will receive n column-vectors of size n, denoted by v1, ..., vn, one by one. After seeing each vector vi, we have to output the product Mvi before we can see the next vector. A naive algorithm can solve this problem using O(n3) time in total, and its running time can be slightly improved to O(n3/log2 n) [Williams SODA'07]. We show that a conjecture that there is no truly subcubic (O(n3-{$\varepsilon$})) time algorithm for this problem can be used to exhibit the underlying polynomial time hardness shared by many dynamic problems. For a number of problems, such as subgraph connectivity, Pagh's problem, d-failure connectivity, decremental single-source shortest paths, and decremental transitive closure, this conjecture implies tight hardness results. Thus, proving or disproving this conjecture will be very interesting as it will either imply several tight unconditional lower bounds or break through a common barrier that blocks progress with these problems. This conjecture might also be considered as strong evidence against any further improvement for these problems since refuting it will imply a major breakthrough for combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication and other long-standing problems if the term "combinatorial algorithms" is interpreted as "Strassen-like algorithms" [Ballard et al. SPAA'11].The conjecture also leads to hardness results for problems that were previously based on diverse problems and conjectures -- such as 3SUM, combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication, triangle detection, and multiphase -- thus providing a uniform way to prove polynomial hardness results for dynamic algorithms; some of the new proofs are also simpler or even become trivial. The conjecture also leads to stronger and new, non-trivial, hardness results, e.g., for the fully-dynamic densest subgraph and diameter problems.},

We show that for inputs in n dimensions, the existence of efficient streaming algorithms which can process Omega(n{\textasciicircum}2) updates implies efficient linear sketching algorithms with comparable cost. This improves upon the previous work of Li, Nguyen and Woodruff [Yi Li et al., 2014] and Ai, Hu, Li and Woodruff [Yuqing Ai et al., 2016] which required a triple-exponential number of updates to achieve a similar result for updates over integers. We extend our results to updates modulo p for integers p {$>$}= 2, and to approximation instead of exact computation.},

In 1961 Subbotovskaya proved that, for any boolean function on n variables, setting all but a randomly chosen {$\epsilon$}n variables to randomly chosen constants, reduces the expected complexity of the induced function by at least a factor. This fact was used by Subbotovskaya to derive a lower bound of {\textohm}(n1.5) for the formula size of the parity function, and more recently by Andreev who exhibited at lower bound of {\textohm}C(n2.5/logO(1)(n)) for a function in P. We present the first improvement of Subbotovskaya's result, showing that the expected formual complexity of a function restricted as above is at most an O({$\epsilon\gamma$}) franction of its original complexity, for This allows us to give an improved lower bound of {\textohm}(n2.556{\dots}) for Andreev's function.

  abstract = {For several NP-complete problems, there have been a progression of better but still exponential algorithms. In this paper, we address the relative likelihood of sub-exponential algorithms for these problems. We introduce a generalized reduction that we call Sub-exponential Reduction Family (SERF) that preserves sub-exponential complexity. We show that Circuit-SAT is SERF-complete for all NP-search problems, and that for any fixed k⩾3, k-SAT, k-Colorability, k-Set Cover, Independent Set, Clique, and Vertex Cover, are SERF-complete for the class SNP of search problems expressible by second-order existential formulas whose first-order part is universal. In particular, sub-exponential complexity for any one of the above problems implies the same for all others. We also look at the issue of proving strongly exponential lower bounds for AC0, that is, bounds of the form 2{\textohm}(n). This problem is even open for depth-3 circuits. In fact, such a bound for depth-3 circuits with even limited (at most n{$\varepsilon$}) fan-in for bottom-level gates would imply a nonlinear size lower bound for logarithmic depth circuits. We show that with high probability even random degree 2 GF(2) polynomials require strongly exponential size for {$\Sigma$}k3 circuits for k=o(loglogn). We thus exhibit a much smaller space of 2O(n2) functions such that almost every function in this class requires strongly exponential size {$\Sigma$}k3 circuits. As a corollary, we derive a pseudorandom generator (requiring O(n2) bits of advice) that maps n bits into a larger number of bits so that computing parity on the range is hard for {$\Sigma$}k3 circuits. Our main technical lemma is an algorithm that, for any fixed {$\varepsilon>$}0, represents an arbitrary k-CNF formula as a disjunction of 2{$\varepsilon$}nk-CNF formulas that are sparse, that is, each disjunct has O(n) clauses.},

In this paper we show randomized lower bounds in the cell-probe model for this well-studied problem[18, 11, 19, 16, 4, 6 ].Our lower bounds follow from a two-party asymmetric randomized communication complexity near-optimal lower bound for this problem, where we show that either Alice has to send {\textohm}(d log n) bits or Bob has to send {\textohm}(n1 - o(1)) bits. When applied to the cell-probe model, it means that if the number of cells is restricted to be poly(n, d) where each cell is of size poly(log n, d), then {\textohm}(d/log2 n) probes are needed. This is an exponential improvement over the previously known lower bounds for this problem[16, 4].},

As an application, we obtain a randomized algorithm for factoring degree n polynomials over Fq requiring (n1.5 + o(1) + n 1 + o(1) log q) log1 + o(1) q bit operations, improving upon the methods of von zur Gathen \& Shoup (1992) and Kaltofen \& Shoup (1998). Our results also imply algorithms for irreducibility testing and computing minimal polynomials whose running times are best-possible, up to lower order terms.As in Umans (2008), we reduce modular composition to certain instances of multipoint evaluation of multivariate polynomials. We then give an algorithm that solves this problem optimally (up to lower order terms), in arbitrary characteristic. The main idea is to lift to characteristic 0, apply a small number of rounds of multimodular reduction, and finish with a small number of multidimensional FFTs. The final evaluations are then reconstructed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. As a bonus, we obtain a very efficient data structure supporting polynomial evaluation queries, which is of independent interest. Our algorithm uses techniques which are commonly employed in practice, so it may be competitive for real problem sizes. This contrasts with previous asymptotically fast methods relying on fast matrix multiplication.},

  abstract = {We give the first representation-independent hardness results for PAC learning intersections of halfspaces, a central concept class in computational learning theory. Our hardness results are derived from two public-key cryptosystems due to Regev, which are based on the worst-case hardness of well-studied lattice problems. Specifically, we prove that a polynomial-time algorithm for PAC learning intersections of nepsi halfspaces (for a constant epsi {$>$} 0) in n dimensions would yield a polynomial-time solution to Otilde(n1.5)-uSVP (unique shortest vector problem). We also prove that PAC learning intersections of nepsi low-weight half-spaces would yield a polynomial-time quantum solution to Otilde(n1.5)-SVP and Otilde(n1.5)-SIVP (shortest vector problem and shortest independent vector problem, respectively). By making stronger assumptions about the hardness of uSVP, SVP, and SIVP, we show that there is no polynomial-time algorithm for learning intersections of log c n halfspaces in n dimensions, for c {$>$} 0 sufficiently large. Our approach also yields the first representation-independent hardness results for learning polynomial-size depth-2 neural networks and polynomial-size depth-3 arithmetic circuits},

  abstract = {In this work we observe a tight connection between three topics: NC0 cryptography, NC0 range avoidance, and static data structure lower bounds. Using this connection, we leverage techniques from the cryptanalysis of NC0 PRGs to prove state-of-the-art results in the latter two subjects. Our main result is a quadratic improvement to the best known static data structure lower bounds, breaking a barrier which has stood for several decades. Prior to our work, the best known lower bound for any explicit problem with M inputs and N queries was SNt1(logM)1-t1 for any setting of the word length w (where S= space and t= time) (Siegel `89). We prove, for the same class of explicit problems considered by Siegel, a quadratically stronger lower bound of the form SNt2(logM)1-t22-O(w)~ for all even t0. Second, for the restricted class of nonadaptive bit probe data structures, we improve on this lower bound polynomially: for all odd constants t1 we give an explicit problem with N queries and MNO(1) inputs and prove a lower bound S(Nt2+t) for some constant t0. Our results build off of an exciting body of work on refuting semi-random CSPs. We then utilize our explicit cell probe lower bounds to obtain the best known unconditional algorithms for NC0 range avoidance: we can solve any instance with stretch nm in polynomial time once mnt2 when t is even; with the aid of an NP oracle we can solve any instance with mnt2-t for t0 when t is odd. Finally, using our main correspondence we establish novel barrier results for obtaining significant improvements to our cell probe lower bounds: (i) near-optimal space lower bounds for an explicit problem with t=4w=1~ implies EXPNPNC1~; (ii) under the widely-believed assumption that polynomial-stretch NC0 PRGs exist, there is no natural proof of a lower bound of the form SN(1) when t=(1), w=1.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a new technique for proving lower bounds on the update time and query time of dynamic data structures in the cell probe model. With this technique, we prove the highest lower bound to date for any explicit problem, namely a lower bound of tq={\textohm}((lg n/lg(wtu))2). Here n is the number of update operations, w the cell size, tq the query time and tu the update time. In the most natural setting of cell size w={$\Theta$}(lg n), this gives a lower bound of tq={\textohm}((lg n/lg lg n)2) for any polylogarithmic update time. This bound is almost a quadratic improvement over the highest previous lower bound of {\textohm}(lg n), due to Patrascu and Demaine [SICOMP'06].We prove our lower bound for the fundamental problem of weighted orthogonal range counting. In this problem, we are to support insertions of two-dimensional points, each assigned a {$\Theta$}(lg n)-bit integer weight. A query to this problem is specified by a point q=(x,y), and the goal is to report the sum of the weights assigned to the points dominated by q, where a point (x',y') is dominated by q if x' {$\leq$} x and y' {$\leq$} y. In addition to being the highest cell probe lower bound to date, our lower bound is also tight for data structures with update time tu = {\textohm}(lg2+{$\varepsilon$}n), where {$\varepsilon\&$}gt;0 is an arbitrarily small constant.},

  abstract = {This paper proves the first super-logarithmic lower bounds on the cell probe complexity of dynamic boolean (a.k.a. decision) data structure problems, a long-standing milestone in data structure lower bounds. We introduce a new approach and use it to prove a {\textohm}(log1.5 n) lower bound on the operational time of a wide range of boolean data structure problems, most notably, on the query time of dynamic range counting over F2. Proving an {$\omega$}(lgn) lower bound for this problem was explicitly posed as one of five important open problems in the late Mihai P{\v a}tra{\c s}cu's obituary\&nbsp;. This result also implies the first {$\omega$}(lgn) lower bound for the classical 2D range counting problem, one of the most fundamental data structure problems in computational geometry and spatial databases. We derive similar lower bounds for boolean versions of dynamic polynomial evaluation and 2D rectangle stabbing, and for the (non-boolean) problems of range selection and range median. Our technical centerpiece is a new way of ``weakly'' simulating dynamic data structures using efficient one-way communication protocols with small advantage over random guessing. This simulation involves a surprising excursion to low-degree (Chebyshev) polynomials which may be of independent interest, and offers an entirely new algorithmic angle on the ``cell sampling'' method of Panigrahy et al.\&nbsp;.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the cell probe complexity of evaluating an n-degree polynomial P over a finite field F of size at least n1+{\textohm}(1). More specifically, we show that any static data structure for evaluating P(x), where x {$\in$} F, must use {\textohm}(lg {\textbar}F{\textbar}/ lg(Sw/n lg {\textbar}F{\textbar})) cell probes to answer a query, where S denotes the space of the data structure in number of cells and w the cell size in bits. This bound holds in expectation for randomized data structures with any constant error probability {$\delta$} {$<$}; 1/2. Our lower bound not only improves over the {\textohm}(lg {\textbar}F{\textbar}/ lg S) lower bound of Miltersen [TCS'95], but is in fact the highest static cell probe lower bound to date: For linear space (i.e. S = O(n lg {\textbar}F{\textbar}/w)), our query time lower bound simplifies to {\textohm}(lg {\textbar}F{\textbar}), whereas the highest previous lower bound for any static data structure problem having d different queries is {\textohm}(lg d/ lg lg d), which was first achieved by P{\'a}trascu and Thorup [SICOMP'10]. We also use the recent technique of Larsen [STOC'12] to show a lower bound of tq = {\textohm}(lg {\textbar}F{\textbar} lg n/lg(wtu/ lg {\textbar}F{\textbar}) lg(wtu)) for dynamic data structures for polynomial evaluation over a finite field F of size {\textohm}(n2). Here tq denotes the expected query time and tu the worst case update time. This lower bound holds for randomized data structures with any constant error probability {$\delta$} {$<$}; 1/2. This is only the second time a lower bound beyond maxtu, tq = {\textohm}(maxlg n, lg d/ lg lg d) has been achieved for dynamic data structures, where d denotes the number of different queries and updates to the problem. Furthermore, it is the first such lower bound that holds for randomized data structures with a constant probability of error.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, we present a number of new techniques and tools for proving lower bounds on the operational time of data structures. These techniques provide new lines of attack for proving lower bounds in both the cell probe model, the group model, the pointer machine model and the I/O-model. In all cases, we push the frontiers further by proving lower bounds higher than what could possibly be proved using previously known techniques. For the cell probe model, our results have the following consequences:  {$\bullet$} The first {\textohm}(lg n) query time lower bound for linear space static data structures. The highest previous lower bound for any static data structure problem peaked at {\textohm}(lg n/ lg lg n).  {$\bullet$} An {\textohm}((lg n/ lg lg n)2) lower bound on the maximum of the update time and the query time of dynamic data structures. This is almost a quadratic improvement over the highest previous lower bound of {\textohm}(lg n).  In the group model, we establish a number of intimate connections to the fields of combinatorial discrepancy and range reporting in the pointer machine model. These connections immediately allow us to translate decades of research in discrepancy and range reporting to very high lower bounds on the update time tu and query time tq of dynamic group model data structures. We have listed a few in the following:  {$\bullet$} For d-dimensional halfspace range searching, we get a lower bound of tutq = {\textohm}(n1-1/d). This comes within a lg lg n factor of the best known upper bound.  {$\bullet$} For orthogonal range searching, we get a lower bound of tutq = {\textohm}(lgd-1 n).  {$\bullet$} For ball range searching, we get a lower bound of tutq = {\textohm}(n1-1/d).  The highest previous lower bound proved in the group model does not exceed {\textohm}((lg n/ lg lg n)2) on the maximum of tu and tq. Finally, we present a new technique for proving lower bounds for range reporting problems in the pointer machine and the I/O-model. With this technique, we tighten the gap between the known upper bound and lower bound for the most fundamental range reporting problem, orthogonal range reporting.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider two-party communication complexity, the ``asymmetric case'', when the input sizes of the two players differ significantly. Most of previous work on communication complexity only considers the total number of bits sent, but we study trade-offs between the number of bits the first player sends and the number of bits the second sends. These types of questions are closely related to the complexity of static data structure problems in the cell probe model. We derive two generally applicable methods of proving lower bounds and obtain several applications. These applications include new lower bounds for data structures in the cell probe model. Of particular interest is our ``round elimination'' lemma, which is interesting also for the usual symmetric communication case. This lemma generalizes and abstracts in a very clean form the ``round reduction'' techniques used in many previous lower bound proofs.},

We show that any (randomized) data structure for the problem that answers c-approximate nearest neighbor search queries using t probes must use space at least n\textsuperscript{1+{\O}mega(1/ct)}. In particular, our bound implies that any data structure that uses space {\textbackslash}tildeO(n) with polylogarithmic word size, and with constant probability gives a constant approximation to nearest neighbor search queries must be probed {\O}mega({\l}og n/ {\l}og{\l}og n) times. This improves on the lower bound of {\O}mega({\l}og{\l}og d/{\l}og{\l}og{\l}og d) probes shown by Chakrabarti and Regev {\textbackslash}citeChakrabartiR04 for any polynomial space data structure, and the {\O}mega({\l}og{\l}og d) lower bound in {\textbackslash}Patrascu and Thorup {\textbackslash}citePatrascuT07 for linear space data structures.Our lower bound holds for the {\textbackslash}em near neighbor problem, where the algorithm knows in advance a good approximation to the distance to the nearest neighbor.Additionally, it is an {\textbackslash}em average case lower bound for the natural distribution for the problem. Our approach also gives the same bound for (2-{\textbackslash}frac1c)-approximation to the farthest neighbor problem.For the case of non-adaptive algorithms we can improve the bound slightly and show a {\O}mega({\l}og n) lower bound on the time complexity of data structures with O(n) space and logarithmic word size.We also show similar lower bounds for the partial match problem: any randomized t-probe data structure that solves the partial match problem on \{0,1,{\textbackslash}star\}{\textasciicircum}d for d={\textbackslash}Theta({\l}og n) must use space n\textsuperscript{1+{\O}mega(1/t)}.

Consider incremental connectivity, letting tu be the time to insert an edge and tq be the query time. For tu = Omega(tq), the problem is equivalent to the well-understood union-find problem: proc\{InsertEdge\}(s,t) can be implemented by Union(Find(s), Find(t)). This gives worst-case time tu = tq = O(lg n / lg lg n) and amortized tu = tq = O({$\alpha$}(n)). By contrast, we show that if tu = o(lg n / lg lg n), the query time explodes to tq {$\geq$} n1-o(1). In other words, if the data structure doesn't have time to find the roots of each disjoint set (tree) during edge insertion, there is no effective way to organize the information!For amortized complexity, we demonstrate a new inverse-Ackermann type trade-off in the regime tu = o(tq).A similar lower bound is given for fully dynamic connectivity, where an update time of o(lg n) forces the query time to be n1-o(1). This lower bound allows for amortization and Las Vegas randomization, and comes close to the known O(lg n {$\bullet$} (lg lg n)O(1)) upper bound.},

For example, it applies to partial match, and to near-neighbor problems, either for randomized exact search, or for deterministic approximate search (which are thought to exhibit the curse of dimensionality). These problems are motivated by search in large data bases, so near-linear space is the most relevant regime. Typically, richness has been used to imply {\O}mega(d/ lg n) lower bounds for polynomial-space data structures, where d is the number of bits of a query. This is the highest lower bound provable through the classic reduction to communication complexity. However, for space n lg{\textasciicircum}O(1) n, we now obtain bounds of {\O}mega(d/ lg d). This is a significant improvement for natural values of d, such as lg{\textasciicircum}O(1) n. In the most important case of d = {\textbackslash}Theta(lg n), we have the first superconstant lower bound. From a complexity-theoretic perspective, our lower bounds are the highest known for any static data-structure problem, significantly improving on previous records.},

We consider one of the most basic range problem, orthogonal range counting in two dimensions, and show almost optimal bounds in the group model and the (holy grail) cell-probe model.Specifically, we show the following bounds, which were known in the semigroup model, but are major improvements in the more general models:* In the group and cell-probe models, a static data structure of size n lgO(1) n requires Omega(lg n lglg n) time per query. This is an exponential improvement over previous bounds, and matches known upper bounds.* In the group model, a dynamic data structure takes time Omega((lg n lglg n)2) per operation. This is close to the O(lg2 n) upper bound, where as the previous lower bound was Omega(lg n).Proving such (static and dynamic) bounds in the group model has been regarded as an important challenge at least since [Fredman, JACM 1982] and [Chazelle, FOCS 1986].},

Our bound holds even if the graph is formed by disjoint paths, and thus also applies to trees and plane graphs. The bound is known to be tight for these restricted cases, proving optimality of these data structures (e. g., Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic trees). Our trade-off is known to be tight for trees, and the best two data structures for dynamic connectivity in general graphs are points on our trade-off curve. In this sense these two data structures are optimal, and this tightness serves as strong evidence that our lower bounds are the best possible. From a more theoretical perspective, our result is the first logarithmic cell-probe lower bound for any problem in the natural class of dynamic language membership problems, breaking the long standing record of {\textohm}(lg n / lg lg n). In this sense, our result is the first data-structure lower bound that is "truly" logarithmic, i. e., logarithmic in the problem size counted in bits. Obtaining such a bound is listed as one of three major challenges for future research by Miltersen [13] (the other two challenges remain unsolved). Our techniques form a general framework for proving cell-probe lower bounds on dynamic data structures. We show how our framework also applies to the partial-sums problem to obtain a nearly complete understanding of the problem in cell-probe and algebraic models, solving several previously posed open problems.},

This was the first technique which could prove a bound higher than communication complexity, and it gave the first separation between data structures with linear and polynomial space. The new technique was, however, heavily tuned for the deterministic worst-case, demonstrating long query times only for an exponentially small fraction of the input. In this paper, we extend the technique to give lower bounds for randomized query algorithms with constant error probability.Our main application is the problem of searching predecessors in a static set of n integers, each contained in a l-bit word. Our trade-off lower bounds are tight for any combination of parameters. For small space, i.e. n1+o(1), proving such lower bounds was inherently impossible through known techniques. An interesting new consequence is that for near linear space, the classic van Emde Boas search time of O(lg l) cannot be improved, even if we allow randomization. This is a separation from polynomial space, since Beame and Fich [STOC'02] give a predecessor search time of O(lg l/lg lg l) using quadratic space.We also show a tight {\textohm}(lg lg n) lower bound for 2-dimensional range queries, via a new reduction. This holds even in rank space, where no superconstant lower bound was known, neither randomized nor worst-case. We also slightly improve the best lower bound for the approximate nearest neighbor problem, when small space is available.},

Previous lower bounds used a reduction to communication games, which was known not to be tight by counting arguments. We give the first lower bound for an explicit problem which breaks this communication complexity barrier. In addition, our bounds give the first separation between polynomial and near linear space. Such a separation is inherently impossible by communication complexity.Using our lower bound technique and new upper bound constructions, we obtain tight bounds for searching predecessors among a static set of integers. Given a set Y of n integers of l bits each, the goal is to efficiently find PREDECESSOR (x) = max (y {$\in$} Y {\textbar} y {$\leq$} x). For this purpose, we represent Y on a RAM with word length b using S {$\geq$} nl bits of space. Defining a = lg S/n, we show that the optimal search time is, up to constant factors: min(logbn, lgl-lg n / n, lg(l/a) / lg(a/lg n * lg l/a), lg (l/a) / lg (lg (l/a) / lg (lg n / a)).In external memory (b \&gt; l), it follows that the optimal strategy is to use either standard B-trees, or a RAM algorithm ignoring the larger block size. In the important case of b = l = {$\gamma$} lg n, for {$\gamma$} \&gt; 1 (i.e. polynomial universes), and near linear space (such as S = n {$\bullet$} lgO(1) n), the optimal search time is {$\Theta$}(lg l). Thus, our lower bound implies the surprising conclusion that van Emde Boas' classic data structure from [FOCS'75] is optimal in this case. Note that for space n1+{$\varepsilon$}, a running time of O(lg l / lg lg l) was given by Beame and Fich [STOC'99].},

We argue that  the known proofs of lower bounds on the complexity  of explicit Boolean functions in non-monotone models  fall within our definition of natural. We show based on  a hardness assumption that natural proofs can't prove  superpolynomial lower bounds for general circuits. We  show that the weaker class of ACO-natural proofs which  is sufficient to prove the parity lower bounds of Purst,  Saxe, and Sipser; Yao; and Hastad is inherently incapable of proving the bounds of Razborov and Smolensky. We give some formal evidence that natural proofs  are indeed natural by showing that every formal complexity measure which can prove super-polynomial lower  bounds for a single function, can do so for almost all  functions, which is one of the key requirements to a  natural proof in our sense.},

Our result additionally implies a lower bound in learning theory.

More generally: For any integer function D(n), up to n/sup /spl epsiv// (for some /spl epsiv/{$>$}0), we give an explicit example of a monotone Boolean function, that can be computed by polynomial size monotone Boolean circuits of depth D(n), but that cannot be computed by any (fan-in 2) monotone Boolean circuits of depth less than Const/spl middot/D(n) (for some constant Const). Only a separation of monotone-NC/sup 1/ from monotone-NC/sup 2/ was previously known. Our argument is more general: we define a new class of communication complexity search problems, referred to below as DART games, and we prove a tight lower bound for the communication complexity of every member of-this class. As a result we get lower bounds for the monotone depth of many functions. In particular, we get the following bounds: 1. For st-connectivity, we get a tight lower bound of /spl Omega/(log/sup 2/ n). That is, we get a new proof for Karchmer-Wigderson's theorem, as an immediate corollary of our general result. 2. For the k-clique function, with k/spl les/n/sup /spl epsiv//, we get a tight lower bound of /spl Omega/(k log n). Only a bound of /spl Omega/(k) was previously known.},

We write               A               +               A               {$\prime$} for the set \{               a               +               a               {$\prime$}:               a               {$\in$}               A               and               a               {$\prime$} {$\in$}               A               {$\prime$}\} and call it the               sumset               of               A               and               A               {$\prime$}. In this paper we address the following question. Suppose that               A               1               ,.~.~.,               A                                m                              are subsets of {$\mathbb{Z}$}/               N               {$\mathbb{Z}$}. Does               A               1               +{$\cdot~\cdot~\cdot$}+               A                                m                              contain a long arithmetic progression?                                         The situation for               m               =2 is rather different from that for               m               {$\geq$} 3. In the former case we provide a new proof of a result due to Green. He proved that               A               1               +               A               2               contains an arithmetic progression of length roughly                                \${\textbackslash}exp (c{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}alpha\_1{\textbackslash}alpha\_2 {\textbackslash}log N\})\$                              where {$\alpha$}               1               and {$\alpha$}               2               are the respective densities of               A               1               and               A               2               . In the latter case we improve the existing estimates. For example we show that if               A               {$\subset$} {$\mathbb{Z}$}/               N               {$\mathbb{Z}$} has density                                \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}gg {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}log {\textbackslash}log N/{\textbackslash}log N\}\$                              then               A               +               A               +               A               contains an arithmetic progression of length               N                                c                 {$\alpha$}                              . This compares with the previous best of               N                                c                 {$\alpha$}                              2+{$\epsilon$}               .                                         Two main ingredients have gone into the paper. The first is the observation that one can apply the iterative method to these problems using some machinery of Bourgain. The second is that we can localize a result due to Chang regarding the large spectrum of               L               2               -functions. This localization seems to be of interest in its own right and has already found one application elsewhere.},

  abstract = {We consider a fundamental problem in data structures, static predecessor searching: Given a subset S of size n from the universe [m], store S so that queries of the form ''What is the predecessor of x in S?'' can be answered efficiently. We study this problem in the cell probe model introduced by Yao [A.C.-C. Yao, Should tables be sorted, J. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 28 (3) (1981) 615-628]. Recently, Beame and Fich [P. Beame, F. Fich, Optimal bounds for the predecessor problem and related problems, J. Comput. System Sci. 65 (1) (2002) 38-72] obtained optimal bounds as functions of either m or n only on the number of probes needed by any deterministic query scheme if the associated storage scheme uses only n{\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}({\textasciicircum}1{\textasciicircum}) cells of word size (logm){\textasciicircum}O{\textasciicircum}({\textasciicircum}1{\textasciicircum}) bits. We give a new lower bound proof for this problem that matches the bounds of Beame and Fich. Our lower bound proof has the following advantages: it works for randomised query schemes too, while Beame and Fich's proof works for deterministic query schemes only. In addition, it is simpler than Beame and Fich's proof. In fact, our lower bound for predecessor searching extends to the 'quantum address-only' query schemes that we define in this paper. In these query schemes, quantum parallelism is allowed only over the 'address lines' of the queries. These query schemes subsume classical randomised query schemes, and include many quantum query algorithms like Grover's algorithm [L. Grover, A fast quantum mechanical algorithm for database search, in: Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1996, pp. 212-219]. We prove our lower bound using the round elimination approach of Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson [P. Bro Miltersen, Noam Nisan, S. Safra, A. Wigderson, On data structures and asymmetric communication complexity, J. Comput. System Sci. 57 (1) (1998) 37-49]. Using tools from information theory, we prove a strong round elimination lemma for communication complexity that enables us to obtain a tight lower bound for the predecessor problem. Our strong round elimination lemma also extends to quantum communication complexity. We also use our round elimination lemma to obtain a rounds versus communication tradeoff for the 'greater-than' problem, improving on the tradeoff in [P. Bro Miltersen, Noam Nisan, S. Safra, A. Wigderson, On data structures and asymmetric communication complexity, J. Comput. System Sci. 57 (1) (1998) 37-49]. We believe that our round elimination lemma is of independent interest and should have other applications.},

  abstract = {The approximate degree of a Boolean function f(x1,x2,{\dots},xn) is the minimum degree of a real polynomial that approximates f pointwise within 1/3. Upper bounds on approximate degree have a variety of applications in learning theory, differential privacy, and algorithm design in general. Nearly all known upper bounds on approximate degree arise in an existential manner from bounds on quantum query complexity. We develop a first-principles, classical approach to the polynomial approximation of Boolean functions. We use it to give the first constructive upper bounds on the approximate degree of several fundamental problems: (i) O(n3/4-1/(4(2k-1))) for the k-element distinctness problem; (ii) O(n1-1/(k+1)) for the k-subset sum problem; (iii) O(n1-1/(k+1)) for any k-DNF or k-CNF formula; (iv) O(n3/4) for the surjectivity problem. In all cases, we obtain explicit, closed-form approximating polynomials that are unrelated to the quantum arguments from previous work. Our first three results match the bounds from quantum query complexity. Our fourth result improves polynomially on the {$\Theta$}(n) quantum query complexity of the problem and refutes the conjecture by several experts that surjectivity has approximate degree {\textohm}(n). In particular, we exhibit the first natural problem with a polynomial gap between approximate degree and quantum query complexity.},

Our result gives the first near-linear lower bounds on the bounded-error communication complexity of polynomial-size DNF and CNF formulas in the challenging k-party number-on-the-forehead model and two-party quantum model: {\textohm}(n/4kk2)1-{$\delta$} and {\textohm}(n1-{$\delta$}), respectively, where {$\delta\&$}gt;0 is any constant.

OR A\_n] given Prob [AND\_i in S A\_i] for {\textbar}S{\textbar}0,1 is a given symmetric function. (In the Linial-Nisan problem, f=OR.). We solve this general problem for every f and k, giving an algorithm that runs in polynomial time and achieves an approximation error that is essentially optimal. We prove this optimal error to be 2{\textasciicircum}- tilde Theta(k{\textasciicircum}2/n) for k above a certain threshold, and Theta (1) otherwise. As part of our solution, we analyze, for every nonconstant symmetric f:0,1{\textasciicircum}n-Gt0,1 and every eps{\i}n[2{\textasciicircum}-n, 1/3], the least degree deg\_eps(f) of a polynomial that approximates f point wise within eps. Namely, we show that deg\_eps(f) = tilde Theta (deg\_1/3(f)+ sqrtn log(1/eps)), where deg\_1/3(f) is well-known for each f. Previously, the answer for vanishing eps was known only for f=OR (Kahn et al.,1996; Buhrman et al., 1999). We construct the approximating polynomial explicitly for every f and eps. Our proof departs considerably from Linial and Nisan (1990) and Kahn et al. (1996). Its key ingredient is a classical result from approximation theory, which gives a certain equivalence of approximation and orthogonality in Euclideanspace. Our polynomial constructions feature new uses of Chebyshev polynomials.},

We show that this problem has commu-nication cost {\O}mega(r{\textasciicircum}2{\l}og{\textbackslash}vert {\textbackslash}mathbbF{\textbackslash}vert), which is optimal. Our lower bound holds even for quantum protocols and even for error probability {\textbackslash}frac12(1-{\textbackslash}vert {\textbackslash}mathbbF{\textbackslash}vert {\textasciicircum}-r/3), which too is optimal because this problem has a two-bit classical protocol with error {\textbackslash}frac12(1-{\textbackslash}vert {\textbackslash}mathbbF{\textbackslash}vert {\textasciicircum}-{\textbackslash}Theta(r)). Prior to our work, lower bounds were known only for constant-error protocols and only for consecutive integers r and R, with no implication for the approximation of matrix rank. We also settle an analogous question for subspaces, where Alice has a subspace S, Bob has a subspace T) and they need to approximate the dimension of the subspace S+T generated by S and T (equivalently, approximate the dimension of S{\textbackslash}cap T).

We construct two halfspaces on 0,1n whose intersection has threshold degree {\textquestiondown}({\textquestiondown}(n)), an exponential improvement on previous lower bounds. This solves an open problem due to Klivans (2002) and rules out the use of perceptronbased techniques for PAC learning the intersection of two halfspaces, a central unresolved challenge in computational learning. We also prove that the intersection of two majority functions has threshold degree {\textquestiondown}(log n), which is tight and settles a conjecture of O'Donnell and Servedio (2003). Our proof consists of two parts. First, we show that for any Boolean functions f and g, the intersection f(x) {\textquestiondown} g(y) has threshold degree O(d) if and only if {\textquestiondown}f - F{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textquestiondown} + {\textbar}{\textbar}g - G{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textquestiondown} {$<$} 1 for some rational functions F, G of degree O(d). Second, we settle the least degree required for approximating a halfspace and a majority function to any given accuracy by rational functions. Our technique further allows us to make progress on Aaronson's challenge (2008) and contribute strong direct product theorems for the threshold degree of composed Boolean functions of the form F(f1, ..., fn). Essentially the only previous technique for analyzing the threshold degree was symmetrization (1969).},

Ideally, one would like to use at most a constant factor more resources compared to the noise-free case. This question has been studied for decision trees, circuits, automata, data structures, broadcast networks, communication protocols, and other models.Buhrman et al. (2003) posed the noisy computation problem for real polynomials. We give a complete solution to this problem. For any polynomial p:\{0,1\}n-\&gt;[-1,1], we construct a polynomial probust:Rn-\&gt;R of degree O(deg p+log(1/{$\varepsilon$})) that epsilon-approximates p and is robust to noise in the inputs: {\textbar}p(x)-probust(x+{$\delta$}){\textbar}\&lt;{$\varepsilon$} for all x{$\in$} 0,1\vphantom\{\}n and all delta{$\in$}[-1/3,1/3]n. This result is optimal with respect to all parameters. We construct probust explicitly for each p. Previously, it was open to give such a construction even for p=x1 {$\oplus$} x2 {$\oplus$} ... {$\oplus$} xn (Buhrman et al., 2003).

A related notion is sign-rank, defined for a Boolean matrix F=[Fij] as the minimum rank of a real matrix M with sgn\&nbsp; Mij=(-1)Fij. Determining the maximum threshold degree and sign-rank achievable by constant-depth circuits (AC0) is a well-known and extensively studied open problem, with complexity-theoretic and algorithmic applications. We give an essentially optimal solution to this problem. For any {\cyrchar\cyrie}\&gt;0, we construct an AC0 circuit in n variables that has threshold degree {\textohm}(n1-{\cyrchar\cyrie}) and sign-rank exp({\textohm}(n1-{\cyrchar\cyrie})), improving on the previous best lower bounds of {\textohm}({\textsurd}n) and exp({\textohm}({\textsurd}n)), respectively. Our results subsume all previous lower bounds on the threshold degree and sign-rank of AC0 circuits of any given depth, with a strict improvement starting at depth 4. As a corollary, we also obtain near-optimal bounds on the discrepancy, threshold weight, and threshold density of AC0, strictly subsuming previous work on these quantities. Our work gives some of the strongest lower bounds to date on the communication complexity of AC0.},

  abstract = {Interactive coding, pioneered by Schulman (FOCS 92, STOC 93), is concerned with making communication protocols resilient to adversarial noise. The canonical model allows the adversary to alter a small constant fraction of symbols, chosen at the adversarys discretion, as they pass through the communication channel. Braverman, Gelles, Mao, and Ostrovsky (2015) proposed a far-reaching generalization of this model, whereby the adversary can additionally manipulate the channel by removing and inserting symbols. They showed how to faithfully simulate any protocol in this model with corruption rate up to 1/18, using a constant-size alphabet and a constant-factor overhead in communication. We give an optimal simulation of any protocol in this generalized model of substitutions, insertions, and deletions, tolerating a corruption rate up to 1/4 while keeping the alphabet to a constant size and the communication overhead to a constant factor. Our corruption tolerance matches an impossibility result for corruption rate 1/4 which holds even for substitutions alone (Braverman and Rao, STOC 11).},

This bound is essentially tight and settles a conjecture due to Tal (arxiv 2019; FOCS 2020). The bounds prior to our work degraded rapidly with t, becoming trivial already at t={\textsurd}d. As an application, we obtain, for every integer k{$\geq$}1, a partial Boolean function on n bits that has bounded-error quantum query complexity at most {$\lceil$} k/2{$\rceil$} and randomized query complexity {\textohm}(n1-1/k). This separation of bounded-error quantum versus randomized query complexity is best possible, by the results of Aaronson and Ambainis (STOC 2015).

This was proved by the multidimensional discrepancy method. We give an entirely different proof of Razborov's result, using the original, one-dimensional discrepancy method. This refutes the commonly held intuition (Razborov 2003) that the original discrepancy method fails for functions such as DISJOINTNESS. More importantly, our communication lower bounds hold for a much broader class of functions for which no methods were available. Namely, fix an arbitrary function f:\{0,1\}n/4-\&gt;\{0,1\} and let A be the Boolean matrix whose columns are each an application of f to some subset of the variables x1,x2,...,xn. We prove that the communication complexity of A in the bounded-error quantum model with and without prior entanglement is Omega(d), where d is the approximate degree of f. From this result, Razborov's lower bounds follow easily. Our result also establishes a large new class of total Boolean functions whose quantum communication complexity (regardless of prior entanglement) is at best polynomially smaller than their classical complexity. Our proof method is a novel combination of two ingredients. The first is a certain equivalence of approximation and orthogonality in Euclidean n-space, which follows by linear-programming duality. The second is a new construction of suitably structured matrices with low spectral norm, the pattern matrices, which we realize using matrix analysis and the Fourier transform over (Z2)n. The method of this paper has recently inspired important progress in multiparty communication complexity.},

One problem that has remained open for several decades, with applications to computational learning and communication complexity, is to determine the maximum threshold degree of a polynomial-size constant-depth circuit in n variables. The best lower bound prior to our work was {\textohm}(n(d-1)/(2d-1)) for circuits of depth d.

To obtain the above result, we develop a novel technique for communication lower bounds, the Degree/Discrepancy Theorem. This technique is a separate contribution of our paper. It translates lower bounds on the threshold degree of a Boolean function into upper bounds on the discrepancy of a related function. Upper bounds on the discrepancy, in turn, immediately imply communication lower bounds as well as lower bounds against threshold circuits.As part of our proof, we use the Degree/Discrepancy Theorem to obtain an explicit AC0 circuit of depth 3 that has discrepancy 2-{\textohm}(n1/5), under an explicit distribution. This yields the first known AC0 function with exponentially small discrepancy. Finally, we apply our work to learning theory, showing that polynomial-size DNF and CNF formulas have margin complexity 2{\textohm}(n1/5).},

Specifically, we show that the communication complexity of f is between Theta(k/log5 n) and Theta(k log n), where k is the number of value changes of D in 0,1,...,n. The unbounded-error model is the most powerful of the basic models of communication (both classical and quantum), and proving lower bounds in it is a considerable challenge. The only previous nontrivial lower bounds for explicit functions in this model appear in the ground breaking work of Forster (2001) and its extensions. Our proof is built around two novel ideas. First, we show that a given predicate D gives rise to a rapidly mixing random walk on Z2 n, which allows us to reduce the problem to communication lower bounds for typical predicates. Second, we use Paturi's approximation lower bounds (1992), suitably generalized here to clusters of real nodes in [0,n] and interpreted in their dualform, to prove that a typical predicate behaves analogous to PARITY with respect to a smooth distribution on the inputs.},

This result is tight and improves the work of Hastad [SIAM J. C., 1998] by removing logarithmic factors. As a consequence of our results, the function defined by Andreev [MUMB., 1987], A : 0, 1n {$\rightarrow$} 0, 1, which is in P, has formula size at least {\textohm}(n3/log2 n log3 log n). This lower bound is tight (for the function A) up to the log3 log n factor, and is the best known lower bound for functions in P. In addition, we strengthen the average-case hardness result of Komargodski et al.; we show that the functions defined by Komargodski et al., hr : 0, 1n {$\rightarrow$} 0, 1, which are also in P, cannot be computed correctly on a fraction greater than 1/2 + 2-r of the inputs, by De n3 Morgan formulae of size at most n3/r2poly logn, for any parameter r {$\leq$} n1/3.

Our proof builds on a previous result by Hastad (SICOMP, 2014) who proved this bound for the special case k=n. Our result improves the seminal result of Linial, Mansour and Nisan (JACM, 1993) and is tight up to the constants hidden in the Omega notation.     As an application, we improve Braverman's celebrated result (JACM, 2010). Braverman showed that any r(m,d,epsilon)-wise independent distribution epsilon-fools AC{\textasciicircum}0 circuits of size m and depth d, for r(m,d,epsilon) = O(log(m/epsilon)){\textasciicircum}\{2d{\textasciicircum}2+7d+3\}. Our improved bounds on the Fourier tails of AC{\textasciicircum}0 circuits allows us to improve this estimate to r(m,d,epsilon) = O(log(m/epsilon)){\textasciicircum}\{3d+3\}. In contrast, an example by Mansour (appearing in Luby and Velickovic's paper - Algorithmica, 1996) shows that there is a log{\textasciicircum}\{d-1\}(m){\textbackslash}log(1/epsilon)-wise independent distribution that does not epsilon-fool AC{\textasciicircum}0 circuits of size m and depth d.
